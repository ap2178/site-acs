      <h1>About the ACED Cohort Project</h1>
      <!--From PIS 14/09/2020  -->

      <details class="about-details">
        <summary>What is the purpose of this project?</summary>
        <p>Many factors such as age, tobacco, sun, radiation or chemical exposure, family history, alcohol and poor diet, lack of physical activity, obesity etcetera, may contribute to whether or not an individual develops certain cancer, how aggressive this cancer becomes, and at what age it develops. Your participation in this project will help us to identify aspects of our biological and genetic make-up, which may predispose a lesion to becoming cancerous or remaining benign. This knowledge will help us understand the causes of cancer and ultimately will help us design more effective tests and treatments for patients. </p>

        <p>Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide and its incidence is increasing due to an ageing population. When cancer is detected early, it is often easier to treat successfully. Unfortunately, nearly half of all new cases of cancer in the United Kingdom are diagnosed at the later stages. It is therefore important that we develop better methods of detecting early forms of cancer to enable better approaches to treatment and increase cancer cure rates.</p>

        <p>The discovery of genes and their functions has a very important role in helping to develop new interventions and treatments of diseases. It is essential, however, to be able to compare variation in genes with variations in characteristics to determine an individualâ€™s likelihood of developing these diseases.</p>

        <p>This project aims to bridge the gap between research and late stage trials; thereby translating earlier cancer detection and intervention approaches into patient benefit. In this way, the project establishes a sampling framework from which participants both with and without health conditions may be invited and selected to participate in future research projects, based on their risk factors, family history and lifestyle, which may predispose them to a certain cancer risk. </p>

      <details class="about-details">
        <summary>What do I have to do if I join the ACED Cohort?</summary>

        <p>On enrolment, you will have a short interview with the research staff where they will go through the project and then ask you to sign a consent form. You will then be asked to complete a risk- profile, health and lifestyle questionnaire where we aim to calculate a cancer risk prediction using all the information you have provided. </p>

        <p>You will also have a standard set of samples collected which will include around 50 mls of blood (about 10 teaspoons) and a fresh sample of urine taken for identifying the variation in certain biological molecules known as biomarker profiling. Where a blood sample is not possible then we may ask you to give us a saliva sample. </p>

        <p>We would also like to measure your chemical and environmental exposure and may ask you to donate hair or toe nail clippings at your appointment to investigate this at a later time. </p>

        <p>We may also ask you to wear a device (E.g. Fitbit or an Apple watch) to collect activity data, which will be in addition to data already collected. This is optional and depends on the availability of the device. </p>

        <p>We may also invite you to participate in other relevant clinical studies depending on your risk profile. We aim to assemble and maintain a group of participants enriched for risk of specific cancers and to track disease outcomes. Participants may be followed up over a prolonged period of time.</p>

        <p>If you have previously had tissue or blood samples taken as part of a previous research study we would also like your permission to have access to them. </p>

        <p>If you have a family history of cancer and members of your family are interested in participating in the   project. We will ask your permission to send a letter of invitation to other family members where they would also be consented and asked to complete the questionnaires and donate blood and urine samples.</p>

      <details class="about-details">
        <summary>What will happen after I enrol?</summary>
        <p>Your level of risk for developing a certain cancer will be assessed according to current standards of care, guidelines and best practice.  Based on your level of risk, you may be invited to enrol in other studies.</p>

        <p>Participants at risk of specific cancers will be followed on a yearly basis over a period of many years. On your return visit we will ask you to complete a short questionnaire and blood and urine samples will be taken. </p>

        <p>Taking part in this study is completely voluntary and if at any point you decide not to have a sample taken it will not in any way affect your standard of care. </p>

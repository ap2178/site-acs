        <summary>What is the purpose of this project?</summary>
        <p>Many factors such as age, tobacco, sun, radiation or chemical exposure, family history, alcohol and poor diet, lack of physical activity, obesity etcetera, may contribute to whether or not an individual develops certain cancer, how aggressive this cancer becomes, and at what age it develops. Your participation in this project will help us to identify aspects of our biological and genetic make-up, which may predispose a lesion to becoming cancerous or remaining benign. This knowledge will help us understand the causes of cancer and ultimately will help us design more effective tests and treatments for patients. </p>

        <p>Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide and its incidence is increasing due to an ageing population. When cancer is detected early, it is often easier to treat successfully. Unfortunately, nearly half of all new cases of cancer in the United Kingdom are diagnosed at the later stages. It is therefore important that we develop better methods of detecting early forms of cancer to enable better approaches to treatment and increase cancer cure rates.</p>

        <p>The discovery of genes and their functions has a very important role in helping to develop new interventions and treatments of diseases. It is essential, however, to be able to compare variation in genes with variations in characteristics to determine an individualâ€™s likelihood of developing these diseases.</p>

        <p>This project aims to bridge the gap between research and late stage trials; thereby translating earlier cancer detection and intervention approaches into patient benefit. In this way, the project establishes a sampling framework from which participants both with and without health conditions may be invited and selected to participate in future research projects, based on their risk factors, family history and lifestyle, which may predispose them to a certain cancer risk. </p>
      </details>

      <details class="about-details">
        <summary>What do I have to do if I join the ACED Cohort?</summary>

        <p>On enrolment, you will have a short interview with the research staff where they will go through the project and then ask you to sign a consent form. You will then be asked to complete a risk- profile, health and lifestyle questionnaire where we aim to calculate a cancer risk prediction using all the information you have provided. </p>

        <p>You will also have a standard set of samples collected which will include around 50 mls of blood (about 10 teaspoons) and a fresh sample of urine taken for identifying the variation in certain biological molecules known as biomarker profiling. Where a blood sample is not possible then we may ask you to give us a saliva sample. </p>

        <p>We would also like to measure your chemical and environmental exposure and may ask you to donate hair or toe nail clippings at your appointment to investigate this at a later time. </p>

        <p>We may also ask you to wear a device (E.g. Fitbit or an Apple watch) to collect activity data, which will be in addition to data already collected. This is optional and depends on the availability of the device. </p>

        <p>We may also invite you to participate in other relevant clinical studies depending on your risk profile. We aim to assemble and maintain a group of participants enriched for risk of specific cancers and to track disease outcomes. Participants may be followed up over a prolonged period of time.</p>

        <p>If you have previously had tissue or blood samples taken as part of a previous research study we would also like your permission to have access to them. </p>

        <p>If you have a family history of cancer and members of your family are interested in participating in the   project. We will ask your permission to send a letter of invitation to other family members where they would also be consented and asked to complete the questionnaires and donate blood and urine samples.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="about-details">
        <summary>What will happen after I enrol?</summary>
        <p>Your level of risk for developing a certain cancer will be assessed according to current standards of care, guidelines and best practice.  Based on your level of risk, you may be invited to enrol in other studies.</p>

        <p>Participants at risk of specific cancers will be followed on a yearly basis over a period of many years. On your return visit we will ask you to complete a short questionnaire and blood and urine samples will be taken. </p>

        <p>Taking part in this study is completely voluntary and if at any point you decide not to have a sample taken it will not in any way affect your standard of care. </p>
      </details>

      <details class="about-details">
        <summary>What is the purpose of this project?</summary>
        <p>To understand the causes of cancer and to help us design more effective tests for early detection and treatments for patients with cancer.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="about-details">
        <summary>Why have I been invited?</summary>
        <p>You may have expressed an interest in participating or your doctor or health care professional has indicated that this may be of interest to you.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="about-details">
        <summary>Do I have to take part?</summary>
        <p>Taking part is entirely voluntary.  If you do not wish to take part, this will not affect your future care in any way.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="about-details">
        <summary>What do I need to do?</summary>
        <p>Answer a questionnaire and provide samples including blood (about 10 teaspoons), urine, possibly nail or hair clippings or on rare occasion saliva samples. You will then be assessed as to whether you are eligible for any of our other early detection studies.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="about-details">
        <summary>Why take nail or hair clippings?</summary>
        <p>This is to measure the types of chemicals in the atmosphere you would have encountered. These are usually deposited in your hair or your toe nails. We may prefer to collect toe nail clippings especially if your hair has had various dyes used on it over time.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="about-details">
        <summary>How long would I need to be a participant in the study?</summary>
        <p>For as long as you want to. We hope not to burden you with numerous request and visits. In the first instance your return visit will be on a yearly basis so that we can collect samples and update your medical history. These visits should be quite quick and not take up too much of your time.</p>
        <p>If you are taking part in multiple studies then we will aim to coordinate your visit so that we minimise the number of request required and ensure that you are not burden with not more than 3 studies. </p>
      </details>

      <details class="about-details">
        <summary>Are you able to tell me whether I am at risk of cancer?</summary>
        <p>Your level of risk for developing a certain cancer will be assessed according to the standard of care  and guidance that is currently available. We will be able to add your information into an electronic tool  and this will be able to calculate the likelihood of your risk of developing a particular cancer.  One of our doctors will be able to advise you pending your result and provide you with further information if required.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="about-details">
        <summary>Will you be able to let me know the results of any blood tests? </summary>
        <p>Your blood will only be analysed for anaemia or any abnormality with the function of your liver or kidneys. These will be research bloods and hence the result will be forward to your GP who will then arrange for you to have further blood tests so that it can be analysed at an accredited laboratory.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="about-details">
        <summary>Will you be able to let me know the results of any genetic testing?</summary>
        <p>We do not expect to identify dominantly inherited cancer genes, but if you participate in one of the sub-studies where we are doing genetic analysis to determine cancer risk it is possible that we may discover some associations between some genes and a cancer risk.  If in relation to these sub-studies your blood reveal genetic information that might affect other family members, we may need to know whether you or your family would wish to be informed. Detailed information about this information would only be given to you as set out for that particular study with appropriate genetic counselling. Again, if you change your mind about this decision in the future, all you have to do is let us know. </p>

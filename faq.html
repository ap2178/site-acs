      <h1>FAQ</h1>

      <details class="about-details">
        <summary>What is the purpose of this project?</summary>
        <p>To understand the causes of cancer and to help us design more effective tests for early detection and treatments for patients with cancer.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="about-details">
        <summary>Why have I been invited?</summary>
        <p>You may have expressed an interest in participating or your doctor or health care professional has indicated that this may be of interest to you.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="about-details">
        <summary>Do I have to take part?</summary>
        <p>Taking part is entirely voluntary.  If you do not wish to take part, this will not affect your future care in any way.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="about-details">
        <summary>What do I need to do?</summary>
        <p>Answer a questionnaire and provide samples including blood (about 10 teaspoons), urine, possibly nail or hair clippings or on rare occasion saliva samples. You will then be assessed as to whether you are eligible for any of our other early detection studies.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="about-details">
        <summary>Why take nail or hair clippings?</summary>
        <p>This is to measure the types of chemicals in the atmosphere you would have encountered. These are usually deposited in your hair or your toe nails. We may prefer to collect toe nail clippings especially if your hair has had various dyes used on it over time.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="about-details">
        <summary>How long would I need to be a participant in the study?</summary>
        <p>For as long as you want to. We hope not to burden you with numerous request and visits. In the first instance your return visit will be on a yearly basis so that we can collect samples and update your medical history. These visits should be quite quick and not take up too much of your time.</p>
        <p>If you are taking part in multiple studies then we will aim to coordinate your visit so that we minimise the number of request required and ensure that you are not burden with not more than 3 studies. </p>
      </details>

      <details class="about-details">
        <summary>Are you able to tell me whether I am at risk of cancer?</summary>
        <p>Your level of risk for developing a certain cancer will be assessed according to the standard of care  and guidance that is currently available. We will be able to add your information into an electronic tool  and this will be able to calculate the likelihood of your risk of developing a particular cancer.  One of our doctors will be able to advise you pending your result and provide you with further information if required.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="about-details">
        <summary>Will you be able to let me know the results of any blood tests? </summary>
        <p>Your blood will only be analysed for anaemia or any abnormality with the function of your liver or kidneys. These will be research bloods and hence the result will be forward to your GP who will then arrange for you to have further blood tests so that it can be analysed at an accredited laboratory.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="about-details">
        <summary>Will you be able to let me know the results of any genetic testing?</summary>
        <p>We do not expect to identify dominantly inherited cancer genes, but if you participate in one of the sub-studies where we are doing genetic analysis to determine cancer risk it is possible that we may discover some associations between some genes and a cancer risk.  If in relation to these sub-studies your blood reveal genetic information that might affect other family members, we may need to know whether you or your family would wish to be informed. Detailed information about this information would only be given to you as set out for that particular study with appropriate genetic counselling. Again, if you change your mind about this decision in the future, all you have to do is let us know. </p>

      <p><strong>The Alliance for Cancer Early Detection (ACED) Cohort project aims to build a large group of volunteers who would consider participating in early cancer detection research. If you are 40+ and would like to join the ACED Cohort, please follow the links above to find out more. </strong></p>

      <!--paragraph from Early Detection website https://www.earlydetectioncambridge.org.uk/about/why-early-detection -->
      <p>Cancer that is diagnosed at an early stage (stage 1 or 2), before it has had the chance to get too big or has spread to other areas of the body is more likely to be treated successfully. If the cancer is late stage (stage 3 or 4) and has spread into surrounding tissue or to other organs then it is more difficult to treat and the chances of survival are much lower. <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-us/cancer-news/press-release/2015-08-10-survival-three-times-higher-when-cancer-is-diagnosed-early">A study by Cancer Research UK </a> shows survival for some of the most common types of cancer is more than three times higher when the disease is diagnosed in the earlier stages.</p>

      <p>Early detection research studies need a wide range of participants to identify risk factors and evaluate new techniques. The ACED Cohort project establishes a sampling framework from which people both with and without health conditions may be selected and invited to participate in future research projects based on risk factors, family history and lifestyle. </p>

      <p>This project is organised by ACED Clinic Cambridge, funded by CRUK's Alliance for Cancer Early Detection and sponsored by the University of Cambridge and Cambridge University Hospitals (CUH) NHS Foundation Trust. </p>
